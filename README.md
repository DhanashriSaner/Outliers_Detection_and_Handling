<h1> Outliers_Detection_and_Handling </h1>
 
An Outlier is a data-item/object that deviates significantly from the rest of the objects. They can be caused by measurement or execution errors. The analysis for outlier detection is referred to as outlier mining. There are many ways to detect the outliers, and the removal process is the data frame same as removing a data item from the pandaâ€™s data frame.<br>
<h2>Dataset used </h2>

<h2>Detecting the outliers</h2>
Outliers can be detected using visualization, implementing mathematical formulas on the dataset, or using the statistical approach.<br>
<h3>1. Visualization</h3>
<h4>Example 1: Using Box Plot</h4>
It captures the summary of the data effectively and efficiently with only a simple box and whiskers. Boxplot summarizes sample data using 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. One can just get insights(quartiles, median, and outliers) into the dataset by just looking at its boxplot.
